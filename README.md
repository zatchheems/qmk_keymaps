# QMK Keymaps

Some keymaps I've written along with the associated config for various
[QMK](https://qmk.fm) keyboards.

Built using [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and
flashed via [QMK CLI](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_cli).

## Keyboards

- [XD60](xd60)
- [Lily58](lily58)
- [Tofu68](kbd67)
- [WhiteFox](whitefox) _(categorized under `input_club/whitefox`)_ in
  [QMK firmware repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/input_club/whitefox)

This is an incomplete, and, just like with keyboards, is an ever-growing list.
